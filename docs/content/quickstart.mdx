# Getting Started

Run our quickstart script to install ARK on an existing Kubernetes cluster. If no cluster exists, the quickstart will help you create one.

## Installing ARK

```bash
# Clone the repository.
git clone git@github.com:mckinsey/agents-at-scale-ark.git
cd agents-at-scale-ark

# (Optional) create a .ark.env to supply configuration without the script prompting you interactively
cp .ark.env.local .ark.env

# Install all dependencies and set up ARK
make quickstart

# Test your first agent
fark agent sample-agent "Hello! Tell me about yourself."
```

That's it! ARK is now running with a sample agent ready to use.

To run the [ARK Dashboard](/user-guide/dashboard):

```bash
make dashboard
```

You can then open the Dashboard at: http://127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/
